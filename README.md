# GeoChronoPhotoBlogo

A travel photoblog generator that takes a sequence of images, and extra metadata if required, to generate a bare-bones photo blog. 

Navigation is via a timeline-style view with an accompanying global/local map and an image view port. Images are automatically categorised by gross geolocation and by date if required.

Photos are parsed for EXIF metadata and arranged in chronological, or geographical order. If GPS data is also present then no other data is required for the basic blog to be generated.
